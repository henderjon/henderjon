I am a self-trained developer whose hobby turned into a career. I currently oversee the development of an education based SaaS reading platform that serves an ever growing number of books to hundreds of thousands of students around the world every day.

I'm a fan of the unix philosophy (read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and [here](https://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/) for more information) who is committed to simplicity as both a goal and a method. I believe good individual character builds strong team culture and that is more important than any other consideration. I don't wear flair. I have many principles that inform how I approach what I do.
Some examples are:

- Simpler is better
- Clear is better than clever
- If it's hard to explain it's probably a bad idea
- Maintenance is an actual cost; usually the most significant
- Autonomy and ownership are better than governance and control
- Use the correct categories and measurements
