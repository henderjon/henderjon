I am a self-trained developer whose hobby turned into a career. I currently
oversee the development of an education based SaaS reading platform that serves
an ever growing number of books to hundreds of thousands of students around the
world every day.

I'm a fan of the unix philosophy (read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
and [here](https://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/) for more information about
"worse is better") and I am committed to simplicity as both a goal and a method.
I believe good individual character builds strong team culture and that is more
important than any other consideration. I don't wear flair. I have many
principles that inform how I approach what I do. Some examples are:

- Simpler is better
- Clear is better than clever
- Solve one problem at a time
- If it's hard to explain it's probably a bad idea
- Maintenance is an actual cost; usually the most significant
- Assume it will break and you will have to fix it
- Autonomy and ownership are better than governance and control
- Waste not; want not
- Check to see that you're using the correct categories and measurements
- Most of the effort should be spent clearly articulating the problem to solve
- Don't take down a fence until you understand why it was built
